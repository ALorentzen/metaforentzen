        text: "My name is Anders and I'm for the time being, a junior web developer. I come from the small town of Molde in MÃ¸re og Romsdal. My whole life I've had an interest for computers and technology, but didn't make a career out of it until 2022, when I got hired as a web developer for Lindbak IT. Prior to that, during the Covid pandemic, I used all of my spare time learning HTML, CSS, JS and some PHP. All the effort I put into it paid of in the end. "

        text: "Apart from geeking out on web development, I also have a solid passion for creating art and I try to dabble in various methods and techniques, such as digital drawing and painting and lately trying to do more traditional work on paper. I'll try out any idea I think can be an interesting image, being landscapes or concept art, but it seems I have a knack for creating exaggerated characters in various situations which is the genre I keep getting back to.
